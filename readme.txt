Throughout the project, I had a few different ideas, so I included all the scripts I wrote.

My method is “final_proj_baby”
filter is in auxiliary script to be run after obtaining the output from my method

the varying different coverages worked to obtain data at different coverage for both the baseline and my method

snp_inverter was my original idea, snp-hinted inversion technique… it uses essentially the same algorithm as my method, only it kind of works in the back order. it looks at all the false positives of sips, and uses those as the holes
